## ProviderCloud monorepo

For better DX strongly recommended to use `npm@>=7`.
It can be installed via `npm i -g npm@7` and also it's built-in in node >=15 package.

Use `npm run dev` for development. (port is 3000 by default).

For development use the network mainnet, like this http://localhost:3000/mainnet

See packages/*/package.json `script` section for build, test, lint, etc.
